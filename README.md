# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict heart disease. It incorporates various algorithms like SVM, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and our Hybrid Random Forest and Linear Model (HRFLM) algorithm. It also experiments with an advanced Extension Extreme Machine Learning (EML) algorithm.

## Dataset
The project uses the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset, included in the `heart_dataset` folder.

## Features
- **Data Upload:** Seamless upload of the heart disease dataset.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleansing and preparation of data for analysis.
- **Algorithm Implementation:** SVM, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, ANN, HRFLM, and EML.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Compares algorithm accuracies using a graphical interface.
- **User Interface:** Easy-to-use interface for running and evaluating models.

## File Structure
- `Main.py`: The main script to run the project.
- `/algorithms`: Contains individual algorithm implementations.
- `/data`: Location for the dataset and preprocessing scripts.
- `/results`: Stores the output and comparison graphs.

## Running the Project
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries are installed.
2. Run `python Main.py` to start the application.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to process data and run algorithms.

## Dependencies
List of Python libraries required, such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, etc.

## Results
The project aims to compare the accuracy of traditional algorithms with our proposed HRFLM and EML models, demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid and advanced machine learning techniques in medical diagnosis.
